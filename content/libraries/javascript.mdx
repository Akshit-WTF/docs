## Installation

`npm install @top-gg/sdk` or `yarn add @top-gg/sdk`

We recommend keeping your configuration inside a separate config file like `config.json` (or the configuration storage of your choice) instead of harcoding it in your source code so you can keep it out of version control.

```json:title=/config.json
{
  "token": "your-token-here"
}
```

## Posting bot stats

Posting your bot's statistics is a quick and easy way to show how many people use your bot. There's a simple library that uses our SDK to post statistics: topgg-autoposter

## Webhooks

The API can also be configured to receive events for when users vote for your bot through webhooks via express. You must first configure webhooks in your bot through the dashboard before using this.

```js:title=/index.js
const Topgg = require("@top-gg/sdk");
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

const webhook = new Topgg.Webhook("your webhook auth");

app.post("/dblwebhook", webhook.middleware(), (req, res) => {
  // req.vote wil lbe your vote object, e.g
  console.log(req.vote.user); // 395526710101278721 < user who voted
});

app.listen(80);
```
